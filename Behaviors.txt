Snake starts out small.

When it eats a target it grows.

If it crashes into a wall or itself, snake dies.

After a death, snake is small again and target is randomly replotted, starting with 1.

When all 9 targets are successfully eaten, the level increases.

Levels > 1 contain obstacles.

Scoring: (target # * 100)

When snake grows, the end pauses while the front grows by however much.
